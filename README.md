# Weight-Aircraft-Forecasting

### Introduction

The main purpose of this repository is to forecast the weight that one aircraft would have at the Take-Off. In addition, the methodology used is going to be as simpler as possible due to the fact that the main idea could be running this code on a streaming data in a Big Data Plataform. Thus, an easy data dealing could minimize cost to the company besides meeting the requirements of the job.

### Data source

The dataset used was collected from the measures of a flying company has done in order to study the problem above exposed. It implies that it is a real problem and for this reason I am not going to upload the data here.

### Data description

This dataset contains 29731 rows and 14 columns. Each variable represents one information that the company can extract when one user decides to carry out a flight or when you decide to buy a ticket. The variables measured are the following:

- **DepartureDate:** Date of the flight

- **DepartureYear:** Year of the flight

- **DepartureMonth:** Month of the flight

- **DepartureDay:** Day of the flight

- **FlightNumber:** Flight's ID

- **DepartureAirport:** Place where you start your journey

- **ArrivalAirport:** Place where you finish your journey

- **Route:** Mix of both above variables

- **ActualFlightTime:** Flight time in minutes

- **ActualTotalFuel:** Fuel used in the route

- **ActualTOW:** Take-Off Weight, Take off weight of the aircraft in kg

- **FLownPasengers:** Number of passengers on board the aircraft

- **BagsCount:** Number of checked in bags

- **FlightBagsWeight:** Baggage weight in kg
